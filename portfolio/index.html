            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I am a third year at the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire. 
                I am currently going for a major in software engineering and a minor in informational systems. 
                Some of my outside of school hobbies include painting mostly landscapes, watching movies and TV, 
                playing video games with my friends when I get the time too, and hanging out with my two cats pippin and scooter. 
                I am originally from Holmen Wisconsin just outside La Crosse. I am one of three siblings, 
                I have a older brother and younger sister. 
                My hopes are to graduate in one to two years with my degrees and get a job in software engineering.
